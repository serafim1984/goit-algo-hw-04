Results of time measurement shows that method 'sort' and function 'sorted()' works considerably faster especially with longer arrays than using separately merge sorting or insertion sorting algoritms.

In general in complies with theoretical time comlexity of this argoritms where insertion sort have highest complexity O(n^2) and merge sort have O(n * log n) and Timsort used in .sort and sorted() O(n * log n) but for sorted data O(n).

In spite using the same Timsort algorithm sorted() works faster than .sort due to .sort also modify existing array
